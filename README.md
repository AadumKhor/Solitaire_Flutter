## Description

Solitaire or Klondike implemented originally by Microsoft is a single player game. This is just a simple implementation of it in Flutter with similar but not the exact same functionalities.

## Rules  
  1. Cards are to be arranged in order from King to Ace with alternate suit pattern (i.e Red Black Red.. or Black Red Black...) and each new pile has to start with a King. Failing this can lead to losing the game.
  2. Bottom columns go from King to Ace while top row goes from Ace to King. 
  3. Clicking on the deck will give out new cards that can be either put on the top row or bottom column.
  4. Cards once submitted to the top row cannot be brought back to the game screen.
  5. Reset the board if you feel like there is no winning combination
  
 ## Cards
  All the cards are '.png' files that are taken from itch.io as free game assets. The pixelated look of the cards gives the game a good look. 
  Cards are named carefully so that the correct png can be assigned to the empty card container.

  ## Future Scope  
    1. Start Screen can be made better.
    2. Spider Solitaire can be implemented in the same app.
    3. Various modes including Texas , Vegas etc can be added to make the game more engaging.
